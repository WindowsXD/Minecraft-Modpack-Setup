# Minecraft-Modpack-Setup
A quick tutorial for setting up Minecraft modpacks that I use on my server

## Step 1: Download CurseForge

1. Download CurseForge from their website:

   [CurseForge Download](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)
   
2. Launch and follow the directions on the CurseForge installer
   
3. CurseForge should automatically detect your Minecraft (if it is installed).

   If this is not the case, follow the directions listed on this support page:  
   [Getting Started](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000221982-getting-started)
   
4. Select the Minecraft tab in your CurseForge home

   ![Select Minecraft](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e427e97-7ec4-4232-bc9e-ce51f1748733)

You can now download and create modpacks for Minecraft on this tab. You can stop here if you'd like to play your own modpacks. If you want to download and use the modpacks on my server, follow the next steps.

## Step 2: Download and Install Modpacks

Modpacks can be found in ~~this GitHub repository~~ (*working on it right now*), or the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19DYSihx3CfR8z9VniU-3qBpUtJxzoNrc?usp=drive_link).

1. Download Modpack

  The modpacks offered will be .zip files. Download them into a folder you will remember (like the downloads folder).
  
2. Install modpack on CurseForge

  1. Select import under "My Modpacks" in the Minecraft tab in CurseForge

     ![CurseForge Import](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/633a04f8-b2ce-4904-b6d2-de4b6a7d960f)

  2. Select the desired modpack and click open. The download will take a while for larger packs.

  4. Allocate RAM to the modpack
     To find out how much RAM is installed on your computer, open the **task manager** on **Windows** and select the **Performance** tab. The amount of free memory your PC has should be listed here. A good amount of RAM allocated for Minecraft modpacks should be ~4GB (4000MB), but don't allocate more RAM to Minecraft than your PC has available.
     
     ![task manager ram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fa06d34-6b77-4012-a3e3-0b42524cd1c2)

     With this information, we can start allocating RAM to the modpack profile. Select the profile options in the drop-down menu next to play.
     
     ![profile options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd32de25-39cd-477a-9812-1eb95e238ae4)

     Make sure that the **use system memory settings** box is empty and use the slider to allocate RAM to your modpack profile (the slider is in MB which is 1000 times the GB amount). If your PC specs allow it, allocate ~8GB to a pack (I usually use 16GB since I have 32GB of RAM on my PC).

     ![ram allocation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23a22b71-a80b-42b0-b1a0-4cd668f740ac)

     Select **Done** when you are happy with the settings.

     
5. Launch the modpack

  Hit the **Play** button in the modpack profile.

  ![play modpack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d1a3ed-91e4-4053-b3f7-567df1a6078d)

  This will open the Minecraft launcher, which you can play the modpack from. If this is the first time you are using CurseForge for modded Minecraft, it will ask you to sign in to the launcher.

## Final / Questions

You now have a working modded Minecraft client. You can connect to my server (IP provided in Discord) or play a singleplayer world. If you have any questions, you can send me a pm on Discord and I will try to respond ASAP.
